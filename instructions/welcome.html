    In the following task, you will be presented with pairs of options, and <b>your task is to choose in each pair the
        option you prefer</b>.

    <br><br>
    In each trial, you will choose between two amounts of money that can be granted at certain probabilities.
    For example, you might choose between winning $5 for sure, and some percent of winning a greater prize.

    <br><br>
    <b>Your choices determine how much bonus you get! </b> At the end of the task, one of the choices you made will be
    randomly chosen, and you will win the amount of money resulting from your choice on that trial.

    <!--<br><br>-->
    <!--As an <b>example</b>:-->
    <!--<ul>-->
    <!--<li>If the randomly-selected trial offered the option of $5 for sure, and you chose that option, you would-->
    <!--receive a $5 bonus payment for your participation.</li>-->

    <!--<li>If the randomly-selected trial offered the option of a 50% chance of winning $10 and a 50% chance of-->
    <!--winning $0, and you chose that option, the computer would calculate the probability of the outcome,-->
    <!--and depending on chance, you would win either a $10 bonus payment, or no extra money.</li>-->
    <!--</ul>-->
